Overview:
This Java program is a File Receiver GUI that listens for a file from a sender. 
The program uses a " Socket " connection to receive the file and a verification code to ensure the transfer is secure. 
If the code is correct the file is saved to the specified directory on the user's computer.

Components:
1. " JFrame ": The main GUI window.
2. " JButton ": A button to initiate file reception.
3. " ObjectInputStream ": Used to receive objects (in this case, the verification code and file data) from the sender.
4. " Socket ": Network connection between the sender and receiver.
5. " FileOutputStream ": To save the received file on the local system.
6. " JOptionPane ": Used for displaying input dialogs and messages.

Detailed Explanation of the Code:

1. Class Declaration:
    ---> Code
    public class FileReceiver1 extends JFrame {
    
   - The "FileReceiver1" class extends "JFrame" which means it will create a window (GUI) for the application.
   - The constructor "FileReceiver1()" initializes the window sets up the layout and defines the button for receiving files.

2. Constructor ("FileReceiver1"):
    ---> Code
    public FileReceiver1() {
        super("File Receiver (Localhost)");
        setLayout(new FlowLayout());
        receiveFileButton = new JButton("Receive File");
        add(receiveFileButton);
    
   - "super("File Receiver (Localhost)")" sets the window's title.
   - "setLayout(new FlowLayout())" defines the layout manager for arranging components in the window.
   - A button "receiveFileButton" is created with the label "Receive File" and added to the window.

3. Button Action Listener :
    ---> Code
    receiveFileButton.addActionListener(e -> {
        String inputCode = JOptionPane.showInputDialog("Enter the 6-digit code:");
        receiveFile(inputCode);
    });
    
   - When the "Receive File" button is clicked an action listener prompts the user to enter a 6-digit verification
     code using "JOptionPane.showInputDialog()".
   - After getting the input the "receiveFile()" method is called passing the input code to check the validity before
     receiving the file.

4. Setting Window Size and Closing Operation :
    ---> Code
    setSize(300, 100);
    setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
    setVisible(true);
    
   - This code sets the window's size to 300x100 pixels, and ensures that the application will close when the user clicks
     the close button on the window.

5. Method : "receiveFile(String inputCode)" :
   - This method handles the main functionality of receiving the file. The method receives the file only if the 
     verification code matches the one sent by the sender.

   --->Code
   public void receiveFile(String inputCode) {
       String directoryPath = "YOUR_PATH";
       File directory = new File(directoryPath);
   
   - This sets the directory where the received files will be stored. If the directory does not exist it is created 
     using "mkdirs()".

6. Connecting to the Sender (Socket) :
   --->Code
    try (Socket socket = new Socket("localhost", 1234);
         ObjectInputStream in = new ObjectInputStream(socket.getInputStream())) {
    
   - A socket is created that connects to the sender on the same machine ("localhost") using port 1234.
   - "ObjectInputStream" is used to read objects sent over the network.

7. Receiving the Code and File Information:
   --->Code

    String receivedCode = (String) in.readObject();
    String fileName = (String) in.readObject();
    
   - The code first receives the verification code ("receivedCode") sent by the sender. It also receives the file name
     ("fileName") to know how to save the received file.

8. Code Validation:
    ---> Code

    if (!receivedCode.equals(inputCode)) {
        JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(this, "Incorrect code. File transfer canceled.");
        return;
    }
    
   - The received code is compared with the entered "inputCode". If they don't match, the transfer is canceled and a
     message is shown.

9. Receiving and Saving the File :
    --->Code

    String savePath = directoryPath + "\\" + fileName;
    try (FileOutputStream fileOut = new FileOutputStream(savePath)) {
        byte[] buffer = new byte[4096];
        int bytesRead;
        while ((bytesRead = in.read(buffer)) != -1) {
            fileOut.write(buffer, 0, bytesRead);
        }
    }
    
   - The "FileOutputStream" is used to write the received file data to the specified location.
   - The file is read in chunks of 4096 bytes. If there's more data it is written to the output file until the stream 
     ends (when "bytesRead == -1").

10. Message After File Reception :
    --->Code

    JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(this, "File received and saved to: " + savePath);
    
   - Once the file is received and saved,a success message is displayed showing the location where the file is saved.

11. Exception Handling :
    ---->Code

    catch (IOException | ClassNotFoundException e) {
        JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(this, "Error receiving file: " + e.getMessage());
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
    
   - If any error occurs during the file reception an error message is displayed and the stack trace is printed for 
     debugging.

12.Main Method ("main") :
    --->
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SwingUtilities.invokeLater(FileReceiver1::new);
    }
    
   - This method starts the application by creating an instance of "FileReceiver1". The "SwingUtilities.invokeLater"
     ensures that the GUI is initialized on the Event Dispatch Thread.

Summary:

The program sets up a simple GUI for receiving files from a sender over a local connection. The file is received only 
if the correct 6-digit code is entered by the user. The file is saved in a predefined directory on the desktop and 
the program handles both successful file reception and error situations (like an incorrect code or other I/O errors).
